# week-4-game

## This project displays 4 crystals at the bottom of the page.  The player will be given a target score at the start of the game which ranges from 19-120.  Each crystal has a random value between 1 and 12 which remains hidden from the user until it's clicked.  When a player clicks on a crystal, the crystal's value is added to the player's total score.  

## The objective of the game is to have the player's total score equal the target score.  If this is accomplished, the player wins.  If the player's total score is greater than the target score, the player loses.
